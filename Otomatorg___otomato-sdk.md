## Codebase Analysis

### 1. Buggy Parts

The code seems functional, but there are areas for improvement in terms of error handling and consistency.

Specifically, the phone number type validator has a couple of false positives that are indicated with `fixme:` comments.
```javascript
        it('should validate phone number values', () => {
            expect(validateType('phone_number', '+1234567890')).to.be.true;
            expect(validateType('phone_number', '12345')).to.be.false;
            expect(validateType('phone_number', '+11234567890')).to.be.true;
            expect(validateType('phone_number', '+447911123456')).to.be.true;
            // fixme: it should not accept it
            // expect(validateType('phone_number', '001234567890')).to.be.false;
        });
```
```javascript
        it('should validate email values', () => {
            expect(validateType('email', 'test@gmail.com')).to.be.true;
            expect(validateType('email', 'test@gmail')).to.be.false;
            expect(validateType('email', '@gmail.com')).to.be.false;
            expect(validateType('email', ' test@gmail.com')).to.be.false;
            // fixme: it should not accept it
            // expect(validateType('phone_number', '001234567890')).to.be.false;
        });
```

### 2. Comprehensiveness/Completeness

The codebase appears reasonably comprehensive for its intended purpose, which seems to be providing a set of tools for defining and managing workflows that can be triggered by on-chain and off-chain events.

*   **Data Models:** Includes models for core concepts like Workflows, Nodes, Edges, Triggers, Actions, Parameters and SessionKeyPermissions.

*   **Services:** Includes API services and RPC services which is crucial for interacting with external systems and blockchain data.

*   **Utilities:** Provides helper functions for common tasks like type validation, address balance retrieval, and external variable construction.

However, some aspects could be expanded:

*   **More trigger sources:** Currently supports limited triggers, but could include more specific blockchain and third-party data triggers (e.g., DEX events, more social media triggers).

*   **More actions:** It could add more complex action types like data transformation and aggregation.

*   **Error Handling:** The error handling in `ApiService.ts` could be more robust. Instead of just checking for a status code of 200 or 201, it should also check for other possible error codes and provide more specific error messages.

### 3. Architecture and Seedify-Related Components

The codebase leverages the following seedify-related components:

*   **Models for core building blocks:**
    *   Action
    *   Trigger
    *   Node
    *   Parameter
    *   Workflow

* It implements a workflow-based approach of low code / no code system.
```
The code does not use seedify-related components

# Documentation/Codebase Analysis: Otomato SDK

## Overview

This document analyzes the Otomato SDK's documentation against its codebase to determine the degree of implementation and identify any discrepancies.

## Analysis

### Authentication

*   **Implemented**: The codebase partially implements the authentication flow described in the documentation. The `apiServices` is used, and there are mentions of generating login payloads and getting tokens.
*   **Missing**: The codebase lacks the actual implementation of signing the login payload and the retrieval of `ownerWalletAddress`. These steps are crucial for the authentication process, and their absence means the example in the documentation is not fully functional.

### Creating a Workflow

*   **Implemented**: The codebase contains classes for `Workflow`, `Trigger`, `Action`, and `Edge` which aligns with the documentation.
*   **Missing**: The codebase doesn't show how these classes are used to construct a workflow, nor does it implement the methods necessary to publish and run the workflows (e.g., `workflow.create()`, `workflow.run()`).

### Running a Workflow

*   **Not Implemented**: This section is entirely missing from the provided codebase. There's no evidence of any functions or methods that handle workflow execution or state management.

### Core Concepts

*   **Partially Implemented**: `Workflow`, `Node`, `Trigger`, `Action` and `Edge` classes exist, indicating some level of implementation of these core concepts.
*   **Missing**: The properties described in the documentation (e.g., `id`, `name`, `nodes`, `edges`, `state` for Workflow; `id`, `blockId`, `parameters`, `position` for Node) aren't completely defined or utilized in the provided snippets. Additionally, methods like `setCondition(value)` and `setComparisonValue(value)` for triggers are mentioned in the documentation and partially implemented with basic validation. However, the full implementation with different available triggers depending on different trigger types and setting up backend API interaction is missing.

### Examples

*   **Partially Implemented**: The `Action` and `Trigger` tests use examples like lending rate, price movement and notifications but lack the full workflow context as described in the documentation.
*   **Missing**: The complete workflows outlined in the examples (Swap and Deposit Workflow, ETH Price Monitoring with Split Conditions) are not implemented in the codebase, only tests for the individual components exist.

### API Reference

*   **Partially Implemented**: There are `create()`, `update()` and `delete()` methods in `Action` and `Workflow` classes but they don't do anything except calling the API Services. Also `setCondition(value)`, `setComparisonValue(value)`, `setChainId(value)`, and `setContractAddress(value)` methods exist in `Trigger` and `Action` classes.
*   **Missing**: Workflow methods such as `load(workflowId)` and actions `setContractAddress(value)` (as seen in `Action` class API reference) are not fully implemented.

### Features

*   **Partially Implemented**: The codebase implements Web3 Actions, Smart Account Integration (through address verification), and a Building Block System.
*   **Missing**: Session Key Permissions are not fully implemented. There are calls to the SessionKeyPermission api but there is no implementation on the use of the keys. The architecture might be extensible in theory, but the provided code doesn't showcase the addition of new triggers/actions/services.

## General Observations

*   The codebase focuses primarily on the model definitions for Workflows, Nodes, Edges, Actions, and Triggers.
*   There is a significant gap between the functionality described in the documentation and the actual implementation in the codebase. The core workflow execution logic, session key management, and full examples are absent.
*   The code includes tests that partially cover the features described in the documentation, such as setting parameters and handling different data types. However, end-to-end workflow tests are lacking.
*   Several utility functions are implemented, including those for type validation, external variable handling, and address balance retrieval.

## Recommendations

*   Prioritize implementing the core workflow execution logic, including methods for creating, running, updating, and deleting workflows.
*   Implement the session key permission management system to enhance security and control over automated actions.
*   Develop end-to-end examples that showcase the full capabilities of the Otomato SDK, as described in the documentation.
*   Provide detailed implementation for all missing methods in API Reference
*   Expand test coverage to include workflow execution and integration tests to ensure the SDK functions as expected.
